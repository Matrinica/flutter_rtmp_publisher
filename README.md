# flutter_rtmp_publisher

flutter plugin to publish rtmp data.

Forked from https://github.com/OhYee/flutter_rtmp_publisher. I've migrated to Android Camera2 API and OpenGlView, which greatly improved the livestream frame rate. (from 15 to 30 fps)

**Only work on Android**, 

## Getting Started

Add flutter_rtmp_publisher as a [dependency in your pubspec.yaml file](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/packages-and-plugins/using-packages).
